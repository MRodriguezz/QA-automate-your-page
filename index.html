			<p>Sometimes it can be difficult to know where to start with a computer program as there is so much to complete. First you must break down the problem into smaller pieces and tackle each as their own entity. With code you can precicely describe the steps required to solve the problem and these steps can be completed by a computer! <b>A computer is just a machine that can be programmed</b>, and it can do almost anything so long as a program is written that can tell it what to do!</p>
			<p>Remember that a program really is nothing more that a very specific set of instruction.
			</p>
			<p> At first it may seem strange that we need new languanges in order to tell a computer what do to, but this is due to a number of inherant problems with languages such as English; primarily they are too ambiguous and verbose! So there are a number of programming languages out there to learn that will enable a person to write instructions, or a "program", that will tell a computer what to do.</p>
			<p>Python is a relatively each programming lanugage to start learning and that is what we are going to do next. Writing code in Python means it can be understood by anybody who knows the Python language, but for a computer to understand it the python code must me translated into something a machine can understand. That is what the Python <b>interpreter</b> does, which incidentally is also a <b>program</b>. Python like any other lanuague has a highly defines structure and grammer, which means you must write your code exactly how the Python interpreter expects (or understands it). This of course removes the problem of amiguity.</p>

			<h1>variables</h1>
			<p>Using a Veriable you can create a name and assign a value to that name. The value of the variable can change depending on what you assign to it, and that assignement may change during code execution i.e. "variables can vary". You use the name of the variable within your code statements, and the execution result will look at the value currently held by that variable. You assign a variable by: Name = Expression.</p>
			<p>Also remember that when working with programming languages, "=" does not mean equal to. Instead it means "asssignment"! In addition, common practice suggests that variables should never start with a Capital letter.</p>

		<div class= "header" id="VariablesFunction">Strings
		</div>
		<div class= "Text">
			<h1>Strings</h1>
			<p>Strings are one of the most important data types in computer languages. That is why we dedicate a whole chapter to working with strings in Python.</p>
			<p>Strings are derived data types. A string in Python is a sequence of characters. Strings are immutable. This means that once defined, they cannot be changed. Many Python methods modify strings. For example the replace() method. They do not modify the original string. They create a copy of a string, which they modify and return to the caller.</p>
		</div>
	<div class = subheader>Input, Function, Output</div>
		<div class= "Text">
			<p>When defining a function you will specify the name of the procedure and then within parentheses you will specifiy the name(s) of the inpute to the function. Next you will specity the return value of the procedure, for example:<br><br>
			def rest_of_string(s):
				return s[1:]
			<br> This procedure will simply take a string as an input and output the same string with the first letter removed.<br>
			Remember that any variable assignments within a function will apply within that function only, to use it outside of the funtion the result value must be included in a return value or an output. If there is no return value or output, then the function will actually do nothing at all...well, nothing that you can see anyway!<br><br>
			A function is designe to take one or more inputs, performs a desired action upon those inputs and then produce an Output. For example, the action could be to concatenate 3 strings and you would pass in those strings to the function. For example:<br><br>
			def concat(string1, string2, string3):
				return string1+string2+string3
				<br>
			When using the procedure you would provide the strings to concatenate, such as:<br>
			concat(Add, These, Together); this would output "AddTheseTogether" <br><br>
			The purpose of functions is simply to save time coding repetitive actions or repeating code, you can call the function as and when you need it throughout your application.<br>
			</p>
			<p> This is a small function that will automatically create HMTL:<br>
			# Write a function that takes a concept title and <br>
			# a concept description as input and then returns<br>
			# HTML that you can copy and paste into your notes <br>
			# web page.<br>
			<br>
			def HTMLGen(title, desc):<br>
    		return '< div class = header>'+title+'''< /div><br>
                < div class = text'>'''+desc+'< /div>'<br>
                <br><br>
			print HTMLGen('Auto Gen HTML', 'This is a function to automatically create HMTL')

		    The test expression determines whether or not we will execute the code within the block.<br>
		    When using the OR operand, if the first value equates to True then the second value is not evaluated.
		    <br><br>
		    The contruct of an if statement is as follows:<br>
		    IF< expression>:<br>
		    	< block><br><br>
		    The block will only execute if the IF statement evaluates to TRUE.<br><br>
		    NOTE: You MUST get the indentention correct in Python!<br>
			</p>
			<p> The structure of IF and WHILE LOOPS are pretty much the same, the key difference being that the IF code block will only execute once (if the test condition equates to TRUE), whilst the WHILE loop will keep executing the code block as long as the test condition continues to evaluate to TRUE.<br><br>
			The contruct of an if statement is as follows:<br>
		   		WHILE< expression>:<br>
		    		< block><br><br>
			BREAK gives us a way to stop the loop, even when the test condition is TRUE.<br>

	<div class = subheader>Debugging!</div>
		<div class= "Text">
			<p> When using example code always test it to make sure it works properly to begin with. If you have problems and need to debug your own code, just comment it out to begin with so when you get it working you will be able to see where you went wrong to begin with and learn from it.<br><br>
			Sometimes is is also helpful when debugging code to introduce print statements so that you can see what variables are set to at various points throughout your code. This can help identify where the problem is.<br>
			<br>
			Debuigging Strategy:
			<ol>
				<li>Examine error messages when programs crash
				<li> Work from example code
				<li> Make sure examples work
				<li> Check (print) intermediate results
				<li> Keep and compare old versions
			</ol>

<div class = header ID = "Lists">Lists</div>
	<div class= "text">
		<p> A list can store a number of items separated by a comma.<br><br>
			< list> [< expression>,< expression>,....]<br><br>
			Remember that lists are orders, so it is important you place items in the order you want them.<br>
			Lists can contain more lists and the data types can be mixed, where as strings can only contain characters.<br>
			Remember that the index of the list always starts from 0.<br>
		</p>
		<p> Lists provide us with a way of putting data into an ordered structure and are mutable whereas strings are not. What they basically means is that <b>you can change elements within a list</b> but not a string. However, be careful because if more than one variable references the same list, changing (mutating) the list using one variable will also change the list for all other variables that reference the same list!<br><br>
		To change a value in a list:<br>
		p = 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' <br>
		p[0] = Y <br>
		now p = 'Y', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'
		<br>
		</p>
		<p> Two different ways of referencing the same object is called 'Aliasing'.<br><br>When altering lists within a procedure, you do no need to 'return' the result, since you will be directly mutating the list itself. The reason this does not work with string assignments is that strings are non-mutable i.e. you can't change it, so instead you change the value that the new variable in the procedure refers to, which in turn means you need to return that value from the procedure.
		</p>
		<p> Append will create a new element on the end of an existing list and reference the appended object. That object could be a single element, but it could equally be another list. Either way, it will only result in ONE additional element on the end of the original list.<br><br>
		To append:<br>
		< list>.append(< element>)<br><br>
		Append is a method that will mutate the list it is invoked upon. It is not creating a new list and you do not need to 'return' anything, the list itself will be modified.<br><br>
		Using "+" will actually concatenate the objects and create a new object, so the concatenation of two lists with two elements each, will result in a new list containing 4 elements. If you use this in a procedure then you would need to return the result of the concatenation otherwise nothing will be changed outside of the procedure itself.
		<br><br>
		len will take a list as its input and output the number of elements in that list; it will only count the outer elements.<br>
		</p>

		<div class = subheader>While and For Loops</div>
			<div class= "Text">
				<p> A while loop will continue to cycle as long as the condition is True. For example: <br><br>
				----While [Test Expresstion]:<br>
				--------Do Something until test is false<br>
				----Return<br><br>
				Can also use a "For Loops". These are similar to While loops, but instead of looking for a text condition it will repeat for every element found in the list.<br>
				< for> <em><b>element</b></em> in < list>:<br>
				----< block><br><br>
				example:<br><br>
				def sum_list(numbers):<br>
			    	i = 0<br>
			    	for item in numbers:<br>
       		 		i = i + item<br>
   				return i<br>
				<br>
   				print sum_list([1, 7, 4])<br>
   				#>>> 12<br><br>
   				Elements in a list will have an index location, starting with 0.<br>
   				< list>.index(< value>)<br>
   				If the value is in the list it will return the index location of the first instance of that value, otherwise it will return an error.
   				<br><br>
   				< value> in < list><br>
   				Or could use "not in"<br>
   				If the value is in the list the output is True, otherwise it is False.<br>

		Advantage of a helper procedure is that you can re-use it for other procedures and also test it separately. It can be helpful to use an Assertion for testing using the following syntax:<br><br>
